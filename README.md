# 🏨 Hotel Management System - A Data Structures Project  

A **C++-based hotel management system** that efficiently manages hotel floors, rooms, and booking requests using **various data structures**. Developed as part of our **3rd-semester Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course**, this project demonstrates how fundamental data structures can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## 📌 Features  

- 🔹 **Dynamic Hotel Structure:** Implemented using **Linked Lists** to manage floors and rooms.  
- 🔹 **Efficient Booking System:**  
  - **Queues** for handling regular booking requests (FIFO mechanism).  
  - **Priority Queue (Heap-based)** to process urgent booking requests first.  
- 🔹 **Booking History Management:**  
  - **Stacks** used to maintain booking records.  
  - Allows cancellation of the **most recent booking**.  
- 🔹 **Automated Room Availability Updates:**  
  - Rooms are automatically marked as **Ready** after a certain period.

## 🛠 Tech Stack  

- **Language:** C++  
- **Concepts Used:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Linked List, Queue, Stack, Heap  
- **Development Tools:** g++, VS Code
